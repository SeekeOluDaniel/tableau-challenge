# Tableau-Challenge
 Week 18 Assignment

### Introduction
The objective was to build a set of data reports and visualizations (dashboards) for the New York Citi Bike program. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. As expected, city officials have questions about the performance and improvement opportunities of the program. So this task is really about providing answers to those questions, and uncovering actionable insights.

My approach was to compare activities and metrics between two months: September and December, which represent two major seasons: summer and fall/winter.

The visualizations are available on my Tableau Public web page at  https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBikeNYC23/BikeProgram?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

### Data Description
I downloaded and merged data sets for September and December 2023 bike trip data, from the Citi Bike website ()
The following fields are available in the data, and I changed the column labels to reflect the data using below names:
Ride ID
Bike type (classic or electric)
Start Time
End Time
Trip Duration (in minutes)
Start station name
Start station ID
End station name
End station ID
Start latitude
Start longitude
End latitude
End Longitude
Rider Type(Member or casual ride)

### Tools/Libraries
1. Excel
2. Pandas
3. Tableau Public desktop

### Analysis Report
This report will focus on and seek to provide insights along the following sub-topics:
- Ridership
- Membership
- Bike Type
- Peak vs Off-Peak Hours
- Busiest Days
- Station Popularity
- Recommendations/Conclusion
  
Details are contained in the CitiBike Report.md file.
